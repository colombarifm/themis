Themis is a statistical mechanics software designed to obtain the association
thermodynamics of two structures (ions, molecules, crystals, nanoparticles, etc). 
It generates a configurational partition function by systematically sampling 
the phase space using discrete grids to perform translations and rotations of 
one structure around another. Interaction energy for each microstate can be 
obtained by one of the potentials implemented or by using external softwares.  

Themis is a free software written in Fortran 2003 language, being available at
https://github.com/colombarifm/themis under the GPLv3+ License. It runs under 
Linux environment with gfortran/gcc 5.4+ compilers.  

Since it was written in modules, new potential functions and analysis routines 
can be easily implemented.
